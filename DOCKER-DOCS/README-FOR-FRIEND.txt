USEFUL FILES
====================================

START.bat          - Main start script (use this!)

STOP.bat           - Stop all containers
RESTART-FRESH.bat  - Delete everything and restart

====================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
====================================

PROBLEM: "Docker is not running"
SOLUTION: Start Docker Desktop app first

PROBLEM: Port already in use
SOLUTION: Close any apps using ports 3000 or 8000

PROBLEM: Build fails
SOLUTION: Make sure Docker Desktop is fully started
          (look for Docker icon in system tray)

PROBLEM: Can't connect
SOLUTION: Wait 30 seconds after START.bat finishes
          Containers need time to fully boot up

PROBLEM: Want to start over
SOLUTION: Run RESTART-FRESH.bat
          This deletes all data and rebuilds

====================================
VIEW LOGS
====================================

See what's happening inside containers:
  1. Open new terminal in this folder
  2. Type: docker compose logs -f

Stop logs: Press Ctrl+C

====================================
STOP THE APPLICATION
====================================

Option 1: Close the terminal window (Ctrl+C)

Option 2: Double-click STOP.bat

Data is saved automatically!

====================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
====================================

1. Keep Docker Desktop running
2. First start takes 2-3 minutes (downloads everything)
3. Subsequent starts take 10-20 seconds
4. Your changes are saved automatically
5. All data persists between restarts

====================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS (Optional)
