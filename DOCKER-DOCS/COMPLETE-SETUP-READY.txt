📂 FILES YOUR FRIEND WILL USE
===============================================

MOST IMPORTANT:
→ START.bat              (Double-click to run!)
→ QUICK-START-GUIDE.txt  (Instructions)

SUPPORTING:
→ STOP.bat               (Stop containers)
→ RESTART-FRESH.bat      (Fresh restart)
→ README-FOR-FRIEND.txt  (Detailed guide)

IGNORE:

===============================================
✅ WHY THIS IS BETTER THAN TRADITIONAL
===============================================

TRADITIONAL WAY:
❌ Install Python 3.11
❌ Install pip
❌ pip install requirements.txt
❌ Install Node.js 18
❌ Install npm
❌ npm install
❌ Setup SQLite
❌ Configure environment
❌ Run migrations manually
❌ Create accounts manually
= 10+ steps, many errors possible

YOUR DOCKER WAY:
✓ Install Docker Desktop
✓ Double-click START.bat
= 2 steps, zero errors

===============================================
🐳 WHAT IS DOCKER? (FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING)
===============================================

Think of Docker like a shipping container for code:

SHIPPING CONTAINER:
- Same size everywhere
- Contains everything inside
- Works on any ship
- Isolated from other containers

DOCKER CONTAINER:
- Same environment everywhere
- Contains app + all dependencies
- Works on any computer
- Isolated from other apps

BENEFITS:
✓ Share complex projects easily
✓ Guaranteed same environment
✓ No "works on my machine" issues
✓ One-click setup

===============================================
🎓 KEY TERMS EXPLAINED
===============================================

CONTAINER:
- Isolated environment running your app
- Like a virtual machine but lighter

IMAGE:
- Template for creating containers
- Like a blueprint for a house

DOCKERFILE:
- Instructions for building an image
- Like a recipe for decisions

DOCKER COMPOSE:
- Orchestrates multiple containers
- Like a conductor for an orchestra

VOLUME:
- Persistent storage for data
- Like an external hard drive
